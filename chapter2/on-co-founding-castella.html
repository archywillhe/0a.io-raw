<p>And then of course there were the missed opportunities. The wrong people. The bad teaming-up. The episodes where nothing happens. And the result was a zero-return in investments. No muse befriends; no invention, no hope. You started to question your sanity and have doubt in yourself. Perhaps you are not as computationally advanced as you thought you were. Perhaps you are simply self-delusional and arrogant. Stop masturbating with start-up ideas and go work in a cooperate environment and climb the ladder and get your arse kicked, kiddo. There is no hope for you and you have wasted all your potential, you degreeless piece of fuck.</p>
<p>You see, this is why I’m currently in a position where I have to do a successful start-up and get myself into the spotlight or I will be damned. There is no going back, especially now that I have put my sister at stake as well. On the bright side dad looks pretty happy that we are walking the path of art dealing just like him and mom is glad too and wants to invest.</p>
<p>And there are myriads of indications that as a start-up we have gotten a pretty good timing both tech and market-wise. Now it all boils down to experimentations and feeding the right blocks into the demand-chain. We are pretty damn sure we’re gonna put up a great show this round.</p>
